957. https://leetcode.com/problems/prison-cells-after-n-days/description/

There are 8 prison cells in a row and each cell is either occupied or vacant.

Each day, whether the cell is occupied or vacant changes according to the following rules:

If a cell has two adjacent neighbors that are both occupied or both vacant, then the cell becomes occupied.
Otherwise, it becomes vacant.
Note that because the prison is a row, the first and the last cells in the row can't have two adjacent neighbors.

You are given an integer array cells where cells[i] == 1 if the ith cell is occupied and cells[i] == 0 if the ith cell is vacant, and you are given an integer n.

Return the state of the prison after n days (i.e., n such changes described above).



Example 1:

Input: cells = [0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1], n = 7
Output: [0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]
Explanation: The following table summarizes the state of the prison on each day:
Day 0: [0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1]
Day 1: [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
Day 2: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0]
Day 3: [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]
Day 4: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]
Day 5: [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0]
Day 6: [0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0]
Day 7: [0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
Example 2:

Input: cells = [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0], n = 1000000000
Output: [0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0]


Constraints:

cells.length == 8
cells[i] is either 0 or 1.
1 <= n <= 109
